# parameters for Maximum allowed Path Deviation from goal when in Cartesian Impedance
# the values are divided into translational and rotational
# each of the translational and rotational components is defined as Vector3

# maximum deviation from set goal in m
geometry_msgs/Vector3 translation

# maximum deviation from set goal in radians
geometry_msgs/Vector3 rotation
