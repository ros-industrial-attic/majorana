# Damping parameters for the Cartesian Impedance
# the values are divided into translational and rotational
# each of the translational and rotational components is defined as Vector3

# Spring damping (type: double)
# The spring damping determines the extent to which the virtual springs
# oscillate after deflection.
# For all degrees of freedom (without unit: Lehrâ€™s damping ratio)

# [ratio:0.1-1.0]
geometry_msgs/Vector3 translational
# [ratio:0.1-1.0]
